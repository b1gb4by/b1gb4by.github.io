On MacOS and Linux, it leverages virtual machines such as Lima and QEMU to run containerd or dockerd and Kubernetes (k3s). For Windows systems, we utilize Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). The figure below is taken from rancher how-it-works-rancher-desktop](how-it-works-rancher-desktop.webp) Rancher Desktop provides functions to build, push, and pull images using NERDCTL project and Docker CLI. Note that both nerdctl and docker are automatically included in the path. On Windows, this is done during the installer, and on macOS and Linux, it is done at first run. To use either of these tools, Rancher Desktop must be running with the appropriate container runtime. For nerdctl, use the containerd runtime; for docker, use the dockerd (moby) runtime. About Lima Lima is similar to WSL, and boots a Linux virtual machine with automatic file sharing and port forwarding, and containerd. Lima is intended to be used on macOS hosts, but can be used on Linux hosts as well. About QEMU QEMU is an OSS PC emulator. It runs on Linux, Windows, etc. on various CPUs such as x86, SPARC, MIPS, etc. It has the feature that it can execute instructions of other CPUs while converting them into native code. About k3s k3s is one of the lightweight Kubernetes released by Rancher Labs, featuring a binary size of less than 40MB and a memory usage of only 512MB. Recently, it is expected to be used in IoT and Edge computing. About nerdctl nerdctl is a container manipulation tool for containerd. You can think of it as a docker command for containerd.

Personally, I think it’s the same as GKE Autopilot’s dynamic Node provisioning process. I think Karpenter is an OSS version of that tool. Like GKE Autopilot, Karpenter observes the specification of non-schedulable pods, computes aggregate resource requests, and sends the requests to an underlying compute service (such as Amazon EC2) that has the capacity required to run all the pods. Karpenter also allows you to define custom resources and specify the provisioning configuration for the following Nodes. We found the flexibility to change the configuration to be a significant advantage. Instance size/type, topology (zone, etc.) Architecture (arm64, amd64, etc.) Lifecycle type (spot, on-demand, pre-emptive, etc.) On the other hand, Karpenter can also deprovision a Node when it is no longer needed. This can be determined by setting the Node’s expiration date (ttlSecondsUntilExpired) or when the last workload running on a Karpenter provisioned Node has finished (ttlSecondsAfterEmpty). Either of these two events triggers a finalization that codes the Node, ejects the Pod, terminates the underlying compute resource, and deletes the Node object. This deprovisioning feature can also be used to keep Node up-to-date with the latest AMI. With Karpenter, I believe you can offload Node provisioning, autoscaling and upgrading and focus on running your application. Karpenter works with all kinds of Kubernetes applications, but I think it performs especially well in use cases where large amounts of diverse compute resources need to be provisioned and de-provisioned quickly. (Training machine learning models, running simulations, batch jobs with complex financial calculations, etc.) Currently, it only runs on AWS, but we will keep an eye on it in the future. If I have time, I’ll try to implement it on other clouds as well.
