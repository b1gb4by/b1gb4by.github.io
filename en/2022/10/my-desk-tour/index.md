## About Desk Environment

- I started to improve my home environment when I started working from home. (The current state is about `v3`.)
- The keyboard of Keychron has been changed to Razer PBT Keycap.
- Initially, I had three 23-inch displays, but I wanted a slightly wider screen, so I bought two 29-inch WFHD displays.
- Until the other day, I had been using a horizontally articulated three-screen monitor arm, but it had the disadvantage that it could not bear the weight of the displays and the center of gravity would tilt.
  - By making all the monitor arms independent, I can move them freely.
- I also play games and DJ, so I put some of my equipment there.

## Future Prospects

- Two keyboards take up extra space, so I want to unify them into one keyboard. (If you have a gaming PC with Bluetooth, you can solve this problem.)
- When unifying keyboards, we would like to change from Keychron K2 to the following ergo keyboard.
